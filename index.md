title: About me

## Hello, I'm **Michael Yau**.

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in developing Native iOS Applications, though I
welcome any opportunity to explore other disciplines in depth.

I studied Biology at **[Stony Brook University]**, where I was first exposed to 
programming in Bioinformatics courses, where I **[learned R]** in order to analyze
genomic data from the **[NCBI sequence database]**. From then onwards, programming
became a hobby for me so I learned it on the side while completing my degree.

After learning on my own for a while dabbling with Python/PHP/MySQL, I decided 
to make a shift to iOS Development since it seemed like most of the people that I 
knew owned at least one smart device (mostly from Apple in the US), and Native offers
the best performance. 

After going through some books and tutorials, I decided to join **[TurnToTech]**, an iOS 
Bootcamp, in order to iron out any gaps of knowledge I had in the fundamentals. 

In my spare time, I still go there to help students if they are having difficulty
with the course material, debugging a project, or if they just want a few pointers
in the right direction for building something.
